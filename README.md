# LoL Game Result Prediction & Strategy Analysis
I use machine learning methods including Regression and Classification to make predictions of League of Legends games using the game statistics of 10-minutes early games and full games. By analyzing these results, I have an insight into how different aspects of the statistics influence the game result. Beyond these analyses, I also try to induce the practical significance of the predictions. Assembling the model analysis, the machine will basically know how to make rational decisions along a game to be the winner.
